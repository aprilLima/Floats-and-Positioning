# Floats-and-Positioning
Plain HTML and CSS challenge issued by [META+LAB](https://github.com/csun-metalab/awesome-metalab) before being considered into their summer internship program in 2017. 



Note that this project was done when I had started learning basic HTML and CSS, so naming conventions may not be done as efficiently and elegantly as I could do now.
